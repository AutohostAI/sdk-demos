# Project Overview

This project contains a handful of very basic demo applications, showcasing the Autohost Verification UI, the Admin Dashboard components, and embedding the Guest Portal in an iframe.

The Autohost SDK is for developers looking to build their own KYC Verification UI (AKA the Guest Portal), or adding the Screening AI results to your own secure Admin Dashboard.

# Tech Stack

You must use the following technologies:

- NodeJS v20
- NextJS v14 (App Router)
- TailwindCSS v3
- React v18


NPM Packages used in the project:

- @nivo/line
- @radix-ui/*
- tailwindcss
- tailwindcss-animate
- date-fns


Follow these rules when you write code:

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, "const toggle = () =>". Also, define a type if possible.
- Use JSDoc in JavaScript files to describe the code.
- Think about testing and write tests for the code.
- Consider using Set instead of Array when the primary operations are checking element existence or maintaining unique values. Arrays are preferred for ordered collections and operations like mapping/filtering.
